Starting with Boostrap and the basics of JS, it's been a lot of great review. On Monday when MVC was introducted, my head was spinning. Trying to wrap my head around the how, and why of using MVC was difficult.... not to mention the correct implementation. Surprisingly, on Tuesday things started to click. Throughout the week I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the way a program should flow throughout the MVC pattern. That is, until Friday. When the checkpoint was introduced I had a sort of mental block in how to correctly approach the project, which was odd cause we had done so many  similar projects earlier that week. On the weeked when I had time to re-approach the program, I had much more clarity and was able to resolve a few bugs I was having. Being able to review my checkpoint, and follow the thread of execution throughout the program has really helped me understand how MVC works inbetween files/folders. Moving forward, I'm looking forward to becoming more familar with the pattern; so that I can spend less time trying to remember file structure and more time on the code/syntax itself. Also, I'm setting a goal to complete a few additional coding challenges everyday as I think I need more work with whiteboard/interview prep.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
