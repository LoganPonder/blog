It was the first week since the course started that I really struggled. Being a visual person, conceptualizing alot of the things that are happening in the backend is tough for me. No CSS, no colors, not really my thing. And to cap it all off my team really struggled with the Hackathon project. I decided to take on more a front end role(as expected), and leave the backend to other team members who felt more confident getting started with that. As that day went on, it became very clear that the backend was not really a strength of theirs and when we attempted to connect the two a wave of errors came about, and we never really recovered from those things. Which was really frustrating, as I anticipated to produce the best project in the class that day, we had in fact the worst, with virtually zero functionality. Dissapointed would be an understatement.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v('That being said, coming into this next week I\'m really motivated to kind of "make up" for the Hackathon performance(or lack therof).')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=r.exports}}]);
